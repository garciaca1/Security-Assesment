# OpenVAS Deployment Guide: Comprehensive Vulnerability Management

## 🌐 Understanding OpenVAS: Your Network's Digital Guardian

Imagine your network as a complex fortress. OpenVAS is like a master scout, meticulously examining every wall, gate, and hidden passage for potential weaknesses. This guide will transform you from a curious learner to a skilled vulnerability management practitioner.

## 🎯 Project Context: Catnip Games Security Assessment

In our project with Catnip Games International, we deployed OpenVAS to secure a gaming infrastructure spanning two data centers with nearly 300 Linux servers. Our goal: create a robust, intelligent vulnerability management system.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- A Linux system (Ubuntu/Linux Mint recommended)
- Minimum 4GB RAM dedicated to Docker
- Stable internet connection
- Basic understanding of terminal commands
- Administrative (sudo) access

## 🛠️ Comprehensive Installation Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Our first mission is to create a solid foundation. We'll update system packages and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install core dependencies
sudo apt install -y \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    software-properties-common \
    docker.io \
    docker-compose
```

### Step 2: Configure Docker

Docker provides an isolated, reproducible environment for OpenVAS:

```bash
# Add current user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Activate group changes
newgrp docker

# Verify Docker installation
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

### Step 3: Create OpenVAS Docker Configuration

We'll craft a carefully designed Docker configuration optimized for security and performance:

```yaml
# ~/openvas-docker/docker-compose.yml
cd ~/openvas

# Create docker-compose.yml for mikesplain/openvas
cat > docker-compose.yml << 'EOL'
version: '3'

services:
  openvas:
    image: mikesplain/openvas:9
    container_name: openvas
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "9390:9390"
      - "9392:9392"
    volumes:
      - openvas_data:/var/lib/openvas/mgr
    environment:
      - OV_PASSWORD=admin
      - INSTALL_PVA=true

volumes:
  openvas_data:
EOL

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Launch OpenVAS Container

```bash
# Navigate to docker configuration directory
cd ~/openvas-docker

# Pull latest image
docker-compose pull

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d

#Wait 15 to 30 minutes

# Verify container is running
docker ps | grep openvas
```

## 🔍 Initial Configuration

### Accessing Web Interface
- **URL**: https://localhost:8080
- **Initial Credentials**: 
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin  the password 

### First-Time Setup Recommendations
1. Change default password immediately
2. Configure two-factor authentication
3. Set up email notifications for critical vulnerabilities

## 🎮 Gaming Infrastructure Optimization

For game server environments, we recommend:
- Custom scan profiles minimizing performance impact
- Targeted vulnerability detection
- Low-overhead monitoring

### Creating Game Server Scan Profile
1. Log into OpenVAS web interface
2. Navigate to Scan Configurations
3. Create a "Game Server" profile with:
   - Reduced port scanning
   - Low concurrency
   - Focus on critical vulnerabilities
   - Scheduled during low-traffic periods

## 🔗 Wazuh Integration Workflow

### Configuration Steps
```bash
# Edit Wazuh integration script
sudo nano /var/ossec/integrations/custom-openvas.py

# Update connection details
OPENVAS_HOST = "YOUR_OPENVAS_CONTAINER_IP"
OPENVAS_PORT = 9392
```

## 🛡️ Continuous Management

### Essential Docker Commands
```bash
# Stop OpenVAS
docker-compose stop

# Start OpenVAS
docker-compose start

# Restart OpenVAS
docker-compose restart

# View Logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Update to Latest Version
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Companion

### Common Challenges
1. **Container Not Starting**
   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   docker logs openvas
   ```

2. **Database Initialization Issues**
   ```bash
   # Recreate volumes
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Network Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Verify container IP
   docker inspect openvas | grep IPAddress

   # Test port accessibility
   telnet CONTAINER_IP 9392
   ```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Vulnerability Management

1. Schedule regular but non-disruptive scans
2. Prioritize critical infrastructure
3. Correlate scan results with threat intelligence
4. Develop a rapid remediation process

## 🔮 Future Considerations

Vulnerability management is an evolving landscape:
- Embrace AI-driven predictions
- Implement machine learning detection
- Automate remediation workflows
